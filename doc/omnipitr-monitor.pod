=head1 OmniPITR - omnipitr-monitor

=head2 USAGE

/some/path/omnipitr/bin/omnipitr-monitor --log=... --check=... [--state-dir=...] [options]

Where:

=over

=item * --log (-l) Points to logfile created by I<OmniPITR> tool that should be monitored.

It can contain strftime-type marks - just like --log argument to other
I<OmniPITR> programs.. Unfortunately due to the %x usage by PostgreSQL, We cannot use %%
macros directly. Instead - any occurence of ^ character in log dir will be first
changed to %, and later on passed to strftime.

=item * --check (-c) contains name of check that should be performed.

For list of check, please read L<CHECKS> section.

=item * --state-dir (-s) is a name of directory that can be used to store state
between calls to checks

This is primarily used to report rates or errors - to avoid checking full logs,
and just check from last known position.

=item * options depend on which check being performed.

Most checks don't have any options. List of options for check is supplied in
L<CHECKS> section.

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This script simply reads log files from other I<OmniPITR> tools, and reports
values useful for monitoring in Nagios, Cacti or other tools.

=head2 CHECKS

=head3 last-archive-age

When was the last WAL segment archived. Returns value in seconds being interval
between "now" and the moment when last archive happened.

Requires path to log from I<omnipitr-archive>

=head3 last-restore-age

When was the last WAL segment restored. Returns value in seconds being interval
between "now" and the moment when last restore happened.

Requires path to log from I<omnipitr-restore>

=head3 errors

Lists all errors that happened from last call to errors check in given logfile.

Can have option:

--from

Where value of from is treated as:

=over

=item * Date time in format: ^Y-^m-^d ^H:^M:^S (for example: 2009-12-24
15:45:32)

=item * interval, in seconds (for example: 300 - means check last 5 minutes)

=back

Works with logfiles of all types.

=head3 last-backup-age

Returns when last backup was finished, in seconds that passed since.

Requires path to log from I<omnipitr-master-backup> or I<omnipitr-slave-backup>

=head2 EXAMPLES

=head3 Getting age of last archive:

    .../omnipitr-monitor -l /var/log/omnipitr/archive-^Y-^m-^d.log -c last-archive-age -s /var/lib/omnipitr

=head3 Getting age of last wal restore:

    .../omnipitr-monitor -l /var/log/omnipitr/restore-^Y-^m-^d.log -c last-restore-age -s /var/lib/omnipitr

=head3 Getting errors for raporting:

    .../omnipitr-monitor -l /var/log/omnipitr/archive-^Y-^m-^d.log -c errors -s /var/lib/omnipitr

=head3 Getting errors for raporting, but checking always only last 10 minutes of
logs:

    .../omnipitr-monitor -l /var/log/omnipitr/archive-^Y-^m-^d.log -c errors -s /var/lib/omnipitr --from=600
